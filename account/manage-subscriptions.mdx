- **Site:** The name or title of the site associated with the subscription.
- **Domain:** The domain URL for the subscribed site.
- **Plan:** The specific subscription plan you've purchased for that site (e.g., Simple Site Subscription).
- **Cost:** The recurring cost for the subscription, shown on a monthly or yearly basis depending on your billing cycle.

### Managing Subscriptions

For each subscription listed, you'll have access to one or more options represented by icons on the right side of the table row:

- **Manage Site:** This option allows you to access the administration area for the associated site, where you can make content updates, configure settings, and more.
- **Manage Subscription:** Click this option to view or modify details about your subscription plan, payment method, billing cycle, and other subscription-specific settings.
